# COVID19SQL
An examination of COVID19 Data through SQL


Hi, My name is Rachel and this is my first project!
With this project I examined some COVID-19 Data from ourworldindata.org and developed some queries based on the data. Majority of the queries were for 
later visualization on Tableau. I was inspired to work on COVID-19 data as many businesses, individuals and countries have experienced an impact for 
a little over two years. I found some interesting data and I am going to continuously try to examine the data to find new patterns as time goes.
